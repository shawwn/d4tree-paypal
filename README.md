# d4tree-paypal
This is an example of how to use [d4tree](http://github.com/shawwn/d4tree).

We render [paypal.json](http://rebecca-ricks.com/paypal-data/data/paypal.json) data from [How PayPal Shares Your Data](http://rebecca-ricks.com/paypal-data/)

(You can visualize any JSON data, as long as it has the same structure.)
